Instructions for Cursor

Build a React app with the above structure.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

Make components reusable and modular.

Add navigation with React Router (for single-page scroll or multi-page).

Add animations where appropriate.

Ensure mobile responsiveness.

Connect contact form to EmailJS or a mock backend.

Add placeholder content where necessary, and include instructions to replace it later.

Optional Enhancements

Light/Dark theme toggle

Filterable project gallery

Animated skill bars or charts

Testimonials section

Blog or Articles section

If you want, I can also make a ready-to-copy JSON prompt for Cursor so you can just paste it in and it starts building your React portfolio automatically, including folder structure, components, and placeholder data.

Do you want me to do that?
